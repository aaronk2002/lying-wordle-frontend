# Front-end of Lying Wordle

Lying Wordle is a website that basically runs a game like the original Wordle, but with a few twists. There are two new modes: reduced and lying mode. The reduced mode adds a new tile color, blue, which tells you nothing about the letter in the tile, unlike green, yellow, and gray. At each guess, the computer will always reveal exactly one blue tile. In the lying mode, it is just like the reduced mode, but instead of coloring one random tile blue, it just lies to you about one tile.
